The official website describes **Storyblok** in the following terms:

> Storyblok is the only Headless Content Management System with a Visual Editor. It provides developers with all the flexibility they need to build reliable and fast websites, while giving content creators with no coding skills the ability to edit content independently of the developer.

A **Headless CMS** is a back-end only content management system that delivers content as data to any platform or device via API, rather than having it tightly coupled to a specific website or mobile app. In practice, this means that content creators are able to use a single content repository to deliver content from a single source to endless frontend platforms via API, such as websites, mobile apps, TVs, smart watches etc. In this tutorial we are going to use Storyblok as our preferred headless CMS for our examples.

Storyblok combines its straightforward developing environment for developers and ease of use for content editors to make content creation seamless and interesting.

### Why use headless CMS? 
Because a Headless CMS doesn't restrict you to a specific technology, like PHP and MySQL in the case of WordPress, you and your team are free to build projects with preferred options like having a CMS for React, Angular, Vue, and so on.
